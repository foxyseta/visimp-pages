# `visimp` pages

Static [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) website for
[`visimp`](https://github.com/visimp/visimp).

Before invoking `hugo`, use

```bash
cp content/README.md content/_index.md
```

This way, `visimp`'s README will be used as the website's homepage. The CI
pipeline also takes care of this.
